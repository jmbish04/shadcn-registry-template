# Gemini Deployment Plan

1. Scaffold a Vite-powered React application configured for JavaScript.
2. Integrate Tailwind CSS and configure the blue-forward shadcn/ui design tokens.
3. Generate core shadcn/ui components (button, card, input, label, navigation menu, scroll area, separator, sidebar, sheet).
4. Assemble the dashboard layout with a persistent sidebar and stat cards.
5. Produce a Cloudflare Worker entry point and Wrangler configuration to serve the built assets with SPA routing enabled.
6. Document recommended commands for local development, building, testing, and deployment.
